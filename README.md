# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting data analysis to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and building a logistic regression model with 85% precision.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values and encoding categorical variables to ensure data integrity.

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using Precision. The predictions are saved in `churn_predictions.csv`.
